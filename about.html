  <h2>Jeremy Larkin - Director</h2>
  <p class="editable">
    Jeremy developed an interest in sailing as a young lad in New Plymouth, New Zealand. He pestered his father into building an Optimist with him and would wander round Auckland Marina with sailing magazines spotting his dream keelboats. He taught sailing in Scotland and has crossed the English Channel umpteen times. After moving to Melbourne in 2012, he immediately got involved in ocean and round-the-sticks racing, then started working in the industry in 2013 as a yacht broker.
